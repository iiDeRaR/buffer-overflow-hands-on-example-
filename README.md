This code attacks the cache memory making it overflow if we enter a long enough string to make it clear "yy" is the variable that indicates 
the size in the buffer/cache memory after excuting our code i provided screenshots 
for the code and it's files also i provided a runtime screenshot of the code to confirm the buffer overflow occured 
the value of the variable "yy"!=0
